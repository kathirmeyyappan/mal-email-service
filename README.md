# [MangAlert!](https://www.mangalert.com)
MangAlert is an email service that alerts users when followed manga/anime serializations have come to an end. Users can also view entries in their plan-to-watch and plan-to-read list that have finished serialization, stratified by recent/old completion.

<sub>Note: Users must have a MyAnimeList account to register.</sub>

## Completed Media View
After registering (or logging in to force a user data update), users can view the completed entries in their MAL plan-to-watch and plan-to-read lists. The data is stratified such that entries that have finished serialization in the last 3 months show up in a different section. As this service is useless without a MyAnimeList account, I recommend you try that out! 

To see what a user view may look like, I have linked some (anonymous) MangAlert user profiles below:

## Email Notifications
Granted that the user provides their email upon registration (and does not remove it upon each following login), MangAlert will send monthly emails regarding completed entries from the user's list in the past 3 months. An example of one such email is shown below.
